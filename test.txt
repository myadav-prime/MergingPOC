FEW LINES IN COMMIT - 1
The local branch X.
The remote origin branch X.
The local remote-tracking branch origin/X that tracks the remote branch X.


FEW LINES IN COMMIT - 3
Alternatively, instead of pruning your obsolete local remote-tracking branches through git fetch -p, you can avoid making the extra network operation by just manually removing the branch(es) with the --remote or -r flags:
